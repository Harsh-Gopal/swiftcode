                    Do you enjoy hearing the clicking of the keyboard as you
                    furiously type out code? The keyboard is the most basic
                    tool in a programmer's arsenal; to master such a tool
                    requires training. Enter SwiftCODE. Prepare yourself, find
                    focus, and dive in.

                    Hone your skills in single-player mode. Train to improve on
                    typing speed and accuracy, making every keystroke count.
                    Then, enter the multiplayer fray and challenge up to 3
                    others in a real-time battle of swiftness.

                p.lead.
                    Play with your favorite language, or try a new one, whether
                    it's object-oriented, functional, declarative, or something
                    else altogether. Type code taken from real open-source
                    projects. Practice the hard-to-reach and quirky characters
                    that the language uses.
